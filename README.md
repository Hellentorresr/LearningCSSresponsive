This project focuses on creating a responsive profile card design using HTML and CSS. The main goal of this project is to showcase the skills and expertise of the staff members in an attractive and visually appealing manner.

The project consists of three main sections: header, main, and footer. The header section includes the project title "Our Staff" and a navigation menu with links to individual staff profiles. The main section contains the profile cards for each staff member, including their name, profile picture, and a brief description of their role. The footer section includes a copyright statement.

The design of the profile cards is the key aspect of this project. Each profile card is contained within an article element with a unique ID corresponding to the staff member's name. The profile picture is displayed using thetag, with the source attribute pointing to the respective image file. The profile name is displayed as a caption using the tag.

The CSS file (style.css) is linked to the HTML file to apply custom styles to the elements. The CSS code includes media queries to ensure the design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The responsive design ensures that the profile cards are displayed in a visually appealing manner on both desktop and mobile devices.

The CSS code also includes styling for the header, navigation menu, and footer sections. The header section has a prominent title and a horizontal navigation menu. The footer section includes a simple copyright statement.

Overall, this project demonstrates the ability to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design using HTML and CSS. It showcases the skills of the developer in creating visually appealing layouts, utilizing images, and implementing responsive design principles.
